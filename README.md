# Another Thing

## About

Another thing is a game project where the player is in a universe populated by an infinite number of planets procedurally generated that he can explore. 

I made this project because I love the technical challenge it imposes and I love open world games. 

It also allows me to show my skills in C# and with the [Unity](https://unity.com/) game engine.
